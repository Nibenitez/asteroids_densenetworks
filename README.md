# asteroids_densenetworks
Classify asteroids according rarity using NN sequential models.

This project focuses on the analysis of asteroids using the dataset "NEO Earth Close Approaches.csv". The dataset provides information about close approaches of Near-Earth Objects (NEOs) to Earth. The project is implemented in the form of a Jupyter Notebook.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project is "NEO Earth Close Approaches.csv". It contains information about the close approaches of asteroids to Earth, including their names, dates, velocities, diameters, and other relevant parameters.

Files Included
Asteroids_Notebook.ipynb: This Jupyter Notebook contains the source code for analyzing asteroids using the provided dataset. It includes data exploration, visualization,  insights and  defines sequential models in TensorFlow for building neural networks. 

NEO Earth Close Approaches.csv: The dataset file containing information about the close approaches of NEOs to Earth.

README.md: This file.

Instructions
To run the project, please follow these steps:

Download the necessary files from the repository to your local machine.

Launch Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.

Open the Asteroids_Notebook.ipynb notebook.

Ensure that you have the required Python libraries installed, such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, etc. You can install them using the command !pip install [library name] if needed.

Load the dataset file "NEO Earth Close Approaches.csv" into the notebook.

Run each cell in the notebook sequentially to execute the code and perform asteroid analysis, including data exploration, visualization, and insights.

The notebook will generate visualizations and provide insights into the characteristics and patterns of the analyzed asteroids.

Notes
The analysis in this project focuses on exploring the provided dataset and gaining insights into the characteristics and behaviors of asteroids during close approaches to Earth.

Additional data preprocessing and feature engineering techniques can be applied to further enhance the analysis and extract more meaningful information.

Credits
The "NEO Earth Close Approaches.csv" dataset was obtained from NASA source, providing information about the close approaches of NEOs to Earth.
